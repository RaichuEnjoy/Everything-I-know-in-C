# Everything-I-know-in-C
This is everything I know in the c programming language so far, use to learn, teach or just see my bad code. Expect regular additions (or don't).
Go to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ to see some things, you will have to click around abit to find things (these are C++ docs so some things are different but most things like beep noise files are the same).
